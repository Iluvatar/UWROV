Serial Communication Protocol
-----------------------------
To send data between the various Arduinos and the computer, packets consisting
of two bytes are used. Each packet consists of a header (or prefix) that
identifies what kind of data is being sent, followed by the actual data. This
allows data that does not need to be updated as frequently to be sent less often
as well as eliminates the need for packets to be sent in a particular order.

Each packet corresponds to a particular reading or value that needs to be sent.
For example, each motor power value is sent as a packet, as are the sensor
readings. The headers are usually specified as ascii characters, which allows
them to be used as mnemonics rather than random numbers. The current list is
below.


List of Header Values
---------------------
Motor 1 power: '1'
Motor 2 power: '2'
Motor 3 power: '3'
Motor 4 power: '4'
Motor 5 power: '5'
Motor 6 power: '6'

Motor 1 direction: 'a'
Motor 2 direction: 'b'
Motor 3 direction: 'c'
Motor 4 direction: 'd'
Motor 5 direction: 'e'
Motor 6 direction: 'f'

Pressure sensor value:    'P'
Humidity sensor value:    'H'
Temperature sensor value: 'T'

Valid Data Values
-----------------
Motor power: 0 - 255
Motor direction: '1' or '0' ('1' is forwards, '0' is backwards)
Sensor values: 0 - 255

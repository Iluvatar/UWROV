Arduino - Small microcontroller that is used to control the robot. Two are used
in the current system: a Controller that connects to the Computer, which then
relays data to and from the Rover Arduino.

Bot - See Rover

Computer - The computer (not Arduino) that is connected to the Controller
Arduino and performs most of the processing. Also acts as the Operator Interface
for the Rover.

Controller - The Arduino that acts as an intermediary between the Computer and
the Rover Arduino. Receives motor information from the Computer and sensor data
from the Rover.

Mathematica - The application currently used to connect to the Arduinos from the
Computer. It may be somewhat compared to MATLAB in that it is a text-based
interface used for doing math and has its own language and syntax (I am not
that familiar with MATLAB). It also differs from languages like Java or C in
that it consists of functions rather than sequential lines of code. All the
idiosyncrasies will probably have to be explained in a separate document.

OI - See Operator Interface

Operator Interface - The way the driver interacts with the Rover. Generally
consists of both physical (joysticks) and virtual (_virtual_ joysticks)
compenents.

Rover - Either the actual robot that goes exploring, or the Arduino that
controls it. The Arduino receives motor information from the Controller and
sends back sensor readings.

Installing on Mac OS X
----------------------
The best instructions for installation can be found here:

You don't have to install the Arduino program itself, though you may want to do something similar
for testing purposes. You also don't have to actually close the Arduino IDE, but make sure that the
serial monitor is not running. It is also not strictly required that you keep the SerialIO package
in /Users/username/Library/Mathematica/Applications, though it is probably the best place for it, as
you shouldn't have to modify $Path every time you restart Mathematica. If you do put it somewhere
else, however, just modify the file path in init.m accordingly.

If you encounter errors, make sure you have the correct file path listed in init.m. Also make sure
that you actually replaced 'username' with your username in all the file paths.

Installing on Windows
---------------------
Installing on Windows is fairly simple. Once the package is downloaded, extract it to
C:\ProgramFiles\Mathematica\Applications. Yep. That's it.

You can test it by entering the command <<SerialIO` in Mathematica or by using the programs from the
website above (they are platform independent).

If you have errors, make sure that the file was extracted and is in the right place.
